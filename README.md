# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

The AirBnB Clone project aims to create a web application inspired by the AirBnB concept. The first step in this project is to establish a command-line interpreter for managing AirBnB objects, such as users, states, cities, places, etc.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a tool that allows you to manipulate and manage objects in your AirBnB project. It is designed to perform operations such as creating a new object, retrieving an object from a file or database, performing operations on objects, updating object attributes, and destroying objects.

### How to Start

To launch the command interpreter, execute the main file `console.py` in your terminal. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
 python console.py
```
